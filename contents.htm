		<h3><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial" size="3">By whatever name you call them, Native Flutes, 
		Native American Flutes, Native American Love Flutes, Native American 
		Style Flutes, Native American Style Love Flutes, Indian Flutes, Indian 
		Love Flutes, American Indian Flutes, or Native American Courting Flutes, 
		they all have that sweet haunting sound that appeals to most human 
		beings. To listen to these flutes is a soothing peaceful therapy, but to 
		play one is a dose of powerful medicine for both mind and spirit. It is 
		a tranquilizer for a troubled soul. Come in from a bad day at work, pick 
		up a Native flute and play for 15 minutes. A peace will come over you 
		and your whole countenance. Your mental outlook will improve. Once you 
		experience this you'll need a daily dose of it. <br>
		<br>
		While an experienced musician will enjoy these flutes, they do not 
		really require a musical background or training to enjoy and relax while 
		playing one. These are not pianos with 88 keys and foot pedals. Anyone 
		can pick up a flute and play one. The melodies come easily and naturally 
		after a few moments. This is part of the relaxing magic of these 
		wonderful instruments.</font></h3>
