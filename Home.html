                By whatever name you call them, Native Flutes, Native American Flutes, Native American Love Flutes, 
                Native American Style Flutes, Native American Style Love Flutes, Indian Flutes, Indian Love Flutes, 
                American Indian Flutes, or Native American Courting Flutes, they all have that sweet haunting sound 
                that appeals to most human beings. To listen to these flutes is a soothing peaceful therapy, but to 
                play one is a dose of powerful medicine for both mind and spirit. It is a tranquilizer for a 
                troubled soul.
                
                Come in from a bad day at work, pick up a Native flute and play for 15 minutes. A peace will come 
                over you and your whole countenance. Your mental outlook will improve. Once you experience this 
                you'll need a daily dose of it.
     
                While an experienced musician will enjoy these flutes, they do not really require a musical 
                background or training to enjoy and relax while playing one. These are not pianos with 88 keys 
                and foot pedals. Anyone can pick up a flute and play one. The melodies come easily and 
                naturally after a few moments. This is part of the relaxing magic of these wonderful instruments.
