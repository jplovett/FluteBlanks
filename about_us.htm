<h5>I have recently
acquired a one of a kind machine dedicated to building one piece line bored
flute blanks. </h5>
<h5>The advantages of a line bored one piece flute blank over the
traditional two piece glued together blank are many including:</h5>

									<h5 ALIGN="CENTER" style="text-align: left">4. No possibility of air leaks because of a failed glue joint</h5>

<p ALIGN="left">A good machine to line bore flutes is very expensive and not
in reach of the average flute maker. We feel that since it takes a little less
time to make a line bored flute, the cost of the machine is offset.</p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font SIZE="4" color="#00FFFF">This allows
us to give you all of the advantages above and not charge any more for our
products than our competitors charge.
</font>
</p>
<p>Our goal is to make quality flute blanks available at
reasonable prices. Our main focus is to provide flute blanks for people who want
to make flutes but don't have the tools it takes to make a good blank.</p>
<p>You will
see from the posted prices that in most cases we can do the work and furnish the
wood (mahogany, black walnut, and eastern red cedar) about as cheaply as you can
do it yourself.</p>
